A large source of stress at work originates from information overload, and more specifically e-mail overload. Since e-mail clients are often used for task management [7, 34], we believe that intent- and task-based categorizations might be what is missing from current systems. This paper studies the realization of tasks in e-mail messages to better understand what the intent is behind an e-mail. This taxonomy consists of the dimensions E-mail Act, Reply Expectation and Number of Tasks that are assessed at the message level. The limitation of the reliability and validity research, as we have presented it in the pilot study, is that it was assessed on only a small dataset of 50 email messages. The resulting annotated datasets are available for future research. We can conclude that approximately half of the e-mail messages contain a task. This suggests that much information is delivered, even without a request. This is achieved with a decision tree classifier, which suggests that it is possible to find common rules about the number of tasks in a message. In general, detecting how many tasks a message contains, whether a reply is expected, or what the spatial and time sensitivity of such a task is, can help in providing a more detailed priority-estimation of the message for the recipient compared to existing work.

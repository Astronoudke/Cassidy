We want to interpret recordings in the office real-time in terms of stress and the context in which it appears. In this paper we present a newly collected rich dataset which has these characteristics. To our knowledge, our dataset is the first in which a set of unobtrusive sensors from different research fields was used to collect data in a realistic office context, while stressors. The strength of this dataset is its richness in terms of modalities and its size in terms of the amount of data per participant. First, simulating a realistic work setting and inducing stress was challenging. A second challenge was synchronization of all data. Finally, using different sorts of sensors requires multidisciplinary expertise, like knowledge (and software) for processing physiological, image or Kinect data. Our contribution is to provide a dataset that not only contains raw data, but also preprocessed and aggregated data, which makes it easier for other researchers to use the data.

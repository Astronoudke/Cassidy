Effective search for information often needs more than one iteration: An initial query is modified multiple times to increase precision or recall. Query suggestion is a functionality of a search engine that suggests the user a list of queries to proceed the search session with. We are especially interested in what happens to the effectiveness of personalized query suggestion when user behaviour is not perfect. We use simulations as what-if experiments: we observe how the effectiveness of our system changes with varying user behaviours. The more persevering the user is in examining result lists, the larger the importance of selecting the right query from the query suggester. The less critical the user is in selecting terms from the query suggester (the more trust he has in the suggestions), the lower the cumulated gain of the session. If the user examines few results (`lazy examination behaviour'), clicking on more documents results in higher cumulated gain, even if not all of the clicked documents are relevant. It appears that there is extensive interplay between the examination behaviour and the term selection behaviour on the one hand, and the clicking behaviour or the query modfication strategy on the other hand: both the choice of the most effective query modiâ€€cation strategy and the most effective click model depend on how persevering the examination behaviour and how critical the query selection is. This suggests that query suggestion strategies need to be adapted to specific user behaviours.

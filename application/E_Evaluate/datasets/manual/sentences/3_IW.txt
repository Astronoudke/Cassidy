RegelSpraak is a Dutch controlled natural language (CNL) developed in 2008 by the Dutch Tax Administration (DTA), which has since been employed for the purpose of law execution. It is meant to be comprehensible for legal specialists, IT developers and computers alike, offering a common ground for unambiguous communication about legislation. However, it is not possible to assess whether RegelSpraak, given its current state, is capable of expressing all relevant tax laws. The DTA is therefore seeking to develop a framework for evaluation of rule pattern quality which can be directly used during the process of rule pattern development rather than afterwards. This study focuses on the aspects of and perspectives on quality which may be relevant to assess
in the context of a CNL aimed at automated execution of rules. Two categories of CNLs are those improving readability for human users, and those facilitating an automated semantic analysis (Tommila and Pakonen, 2014). As mentioned above, our set of quality criteria consists of the following: Readability, Recognizability, Explainability, Usability, Completeness, Syntax, Complexity, Efficiency, Compositionality, Domain Independence, Technical Executability. After reviewing the set of quality criteria, we came to the conclusion that most can be interpreted from two perspectives: the human and the machine. On top of the human - machine differentiation, we included the read - write distinction within each perspective, as mentioned in Section 1.2. The next critical step was to differentiate explicitly between the two abstraction levels of concrete, implementable rules, and abstract rule patterns still to be instantiated. Therefore, what was initially the ‘Human’ perspective became the ‘Fiscal’ perspective, and ‘Machine’ changed to ‘Computational’.

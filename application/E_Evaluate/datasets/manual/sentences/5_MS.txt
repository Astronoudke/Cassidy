In this paper, we investigated cognate processing using an off-line rating study and three on-line experiments. We first tested the modelsâ€™ predictions with respect to the sensitivity of the cognate effect to cross-linguistic similarity in a lexical decision study. Next,we considered how the models handled variations in task demands by examining cognate processing in two other tasks, language decision and progressive demasking. The rating study was designed to construct a list of words on a continuum ranging from completely identical cognates, via (semantically equivalent) translation equivalents that moderately resemble each other with respect to orthography and phonology, to words that have a completely different form in two languages. First, facilitatory cognate effects were obtained in L2 lexical decision and inhibitory effects in L1-L2 language decision. Second, in lexical decision and language decision, a discontinuous transition in RTs was observed between identical and nearly identical cognates, which appears to be more in favor of a localist connectionist type of model than of a distributed model. Thus, cognate effects, like the effects for false friends (interlingual homographs and interlingual homophones) are task-dependent. This conclusion was confirmed for the English progressive demasking task, in which no clear effect of orthographic similarity between translation equivalents was found. The findings of lexical decision and language decision can be explained by assuming that (1) form overlap between the two readings of the cognates leads to a frequency-dependent parallel activation of these readings, and (2) both form representations activate a (largely) shared semantic representation and separate language membership nodes. In sum, a localist connectionist model like BIA+ provides both a detailed processing account and a task account for cognate processing in which the results of the three experiments of this study can be interpreted quite well.

We propose that relational reasoning and abstraction are key cognitive processes in modelling. All these processes make use of executive control and goal pursuit, which in turn depends on working memory capacity, which is influenced by attention span and emotional markers. The main forms of abstraction we encounter during modelling are concepts and relations. Abstraction in relational reasoning manifests as flexible switching between concrete and abstract representations, and shifts in focus on certain relevant properties. In conclusion, we argue for a cognitive system enabling modelling in which executive control monitors information processing for integrity of representations. Switching between abstraction levels and different contexts, and inhibiting distracting information are primary processes. Also, it interacts with goal pursuit to maintain relevant goals, making use of aâ€€affective body signals. Executive control is part of WM, which facilitates storage of representations and processing of content information. WM has a limited capacity, which is subject to individual differences. A source of differences is the ability to mediate attention between relevant and irrelevant stimuli competing for processing.

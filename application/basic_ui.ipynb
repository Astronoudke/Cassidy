The highly significant correlation of the rat-ings for cross-linguistic orthographic overlap and the Omeasures indicates that the two measures reflect more or less the same dimension.

Assuming that an item will be recognized more easily when it has a translation equivalent that overlaps orthographically to a larger extent, we predict a negative linear relationship between orthographic overlap and RT for non-identical cognates. Depending on the bilingual word recognition model used for the predictions, RTs should gradually become shorter when similarity increases (distributed connectionist models) or gradually become shorter with similarity but show a steep decline going from non-identical to identical cognates (localist connectionist models)..\n",

      "Summary: The order of S, O, and P ratings was counter-balanced across participants. The same was true for O and P.

      "================\n",
      "Summary: Fourteen items that were marked as unfamiliar by more than one participant or had a mean S-rating that was lower than six, were removed from the data. Due to their relatively small cross-linguistic semantic overlap, such items do not conform to the standard definition of cognates. For the remaining three hundred and forty-six items, there was no significant correlation between their O-or P-rating scores and their English frequency, as indicated by correlations of zero and Ã€zero.four, respectively..\n",

      "Summary: The item set that was ultimately selected has a number of properties. The highly significant correlation of the rat-ings for cross-linguistic orthographic overlap and the Omeasures indicates that the two measures reflect more or less the same dimension. The O-and P-ratings are about equally distributed over the whole judgment scale, suggesting that participants were able to rate the stimuli in a sensitive way..\n",

      "===============================================\n",
      "Summary: In Experiment one, we conducted a lexical decision task involving English words that were translation equivalents varying on a cross-linguistic similarity (cognate to noncognate) dimension. Assuming that an item will be recognized more easily when it has a translation equivalent that overlaps orthographically to a larger extent, we predict a negative linear relationship between orthographic overlap and RT for non-identical cognates. Depending on the bilingual word recognition model used for the predictions, RTs should gradually become shorter when similarity increases (distributed connectionist models) or gradually become shorter with similarity but show a steep decline going from non-identical to identical cognates (localist connectionist models)..\n",

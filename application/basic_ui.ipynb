Assuming that an item will be recognized more easily when it has a translation equivalent that overlaps orthographically to a larger extent, we predict a negative linear relationship between orthographic overlap and RT for non-identical cognates.

The highly significant correlation of the rat-ings for cross-linguistic orthographic overlap and the Omeasures indicates that the two measures reflect more or less the same dimension.

Assuming that an item will be recognized more easily when it has a translation equivalent that overlaps orthographically to a larger extent, we predict a negative linear relationship between orthographic overlap and RT for non-identical cognates. Depending on the bilingual word recognition model used for the predictions, RTs should gradually become shorter when similarity increases (distributed connectionist models) or gradually become shorter with similarity but show a steep decline going from non-identical to identical cognates (localist connectionist models)..\n",
